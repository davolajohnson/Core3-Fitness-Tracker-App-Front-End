# Core3-Fitness-Tracker-App-Front-End
# 🏋️‍♀️🚴🏾‍♂️🏃🏽‍♂️ Core3 • Train. Track. Transform.

Core3 is a full-stack fitness tracker built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).  
It helps users sign up, log in, and manage their workouts — all while staying secure with JWT-based authentication.
